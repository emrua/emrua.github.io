                <p>My name is Johnny Anglin and I have been doing construction for over 45 years.
                I spent most of my life doing beach house construction as well as small projects for friends and family.
                I've got three beautiful daughters, Veda, Emma, and Sara and my wonderful wife Lisa. 
                I have taught my girls all the skills I have and take pride in their abilites to do handy work for themselves now that they are grown.
                I have the same level of pride in my projects and am alway commited to doing my best for my clients.
                </p>
