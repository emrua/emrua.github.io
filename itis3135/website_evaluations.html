            <h3><a href="https://read.macmillan.com/mcpg/the-one-and-only-sparkella/">The One and Only Sparkella</a></h3>
            <p>This is a website for Channing Tatum's children's book.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contrast: Some contrast overall but the button text is very difficult to read.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repetition: Does have repetition throughout the text colors but there are a lot of different font sizes and seems to be a couple different fonts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment: The paragraphs are aligned left so it is difficult to find the start and end of each paragraph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity: There is a good use of proximity for the purchasing options.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Contrast: Lots of contrast. Easily seperates different topics on the page and is simple to read.

                    <li>
                        Repetition: There is repetition within all of the colors and fonts. The images also correlate to these colors.

                        Alignment: Each section on the page has a particular alignment and grouping. It is really easy to read and identify connected content.

                        Proximity: Incredible use of proximity, the related sections are close by each orther or linked in some sort of way. The page is super easy to navigate because of the appropriate proximity grouping.
